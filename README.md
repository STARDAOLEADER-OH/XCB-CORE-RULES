# XCB Core Rules

This repository defines the immutable core mechanisms of the XCB (Star Currency) on the STARDAO platform.

- Token issuance and reserve mechanism
- Fee structure
- Exchange and auction logic
- Weekly fund distribution logic
- DAO governance entry points (not included here)

All logics are to be enforced by smart contracts. No manual intervention is allowed.
